# Photosynthesis: How Plants Make Food (Grades 3-5)

## What is Photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (the air we breathe out).

Think of it like this: Plants are like tiny food factories that use sunshine as power!

## What Plants Need (Ingredients)

1. **Sunlight** ☀️ - The energy source
2. **Water** 💧 - From the soil through roots
3. **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)** 🌫️ - From the air through leaves
4. **Chlorophyll** 🍃 - The green stuff in leaves that captures sunlight

## The Process (How It Works)

### Step 1: Capturing Sunlight
- Leaves have chlorophyll (what makes them green)
- Chlorophyll catches sunlight like a solar panel

### Step 2: Getting Water
- Roots absorb water from the soil
- Water travels up the stem to the leaves

### Step 3: Taking in Air
- Tiny holes in leaves (called stomata) let CO₂ in
- These holes are so small you need a microscope to see them!

### Step 4: Making Food
- Plant combines sunlight, water, and CO₂
- Creates glucose (sugar) for food
- Releases oxygen as a bonus!

## The Magic Formula

**Sunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide → Glucose (food) + Oxygen**

Or:
**6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**

## Why This Matters

1. **Plants make their own food** - That's why they don't need to eat!
2. **We get oxygen** - Plants give us the air we breathe
3. **Food chain starts here** - All food energy comes from the sun originally
4. **Keeps Earth healthy** - Plants help clean the air

## Fun Facts

- One large tree can provide oxygen for 2 people for a whole year!
- Plants do photosynthesis during the day (need sunlight)
- The Amazon rainforest produces 20% of Earth's oxygen
- Without photosynthesis, there would be no life on Earth!

## Parts of the Leaf

- **Blade**: The flat, green part
- **Veins**: Carry water and food
- **Stem**: Connects leaf to plant
- **Stomata**: Tiny breathing holes (on underside)

## Experiments You Can Do

1. **Leaf in sunlight vs. dark**
   - Put one plant in sun, one in dark
   - Which one grows better?

2. **Starch test**
   - Plants store extra glucose as starch
   - Can test leaves with iodine

3. **Oxygen bubbles**
   - Put water plant in bright light
   - Watch oxygen bubbles form!

## Common Questions

**Q: Do plants breathe?**
A: Yes! They take in CO₂ and release O₂ during the day. At night, they breathe like us (take in O₂).

**Q: Why are leaves green?**
A: Chlorophyll reflects green light, so that's the color we see!

**Q: Can plants grow without sunlight?**
A: No, they need light energy to make food. They'll eventually die without it.
