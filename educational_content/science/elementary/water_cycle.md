# The Water Cycle (Grades 3-5)

## What is the Water Cycle?

The water cycle is nature's way of recycling water! The same water has been moving around Earth for billions of years.

Think of it like a never-ending circle: water goes up, comes down, and goes up again!

## The Four Main Steps

### 1. Evaporation ☀️💧
**What happens:** Water turns into invisible water vapor (gas) and rises into the sky

**How it works:**
- The sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, rivers, and puddles
- Heat gives water molecules energy to escape into the air
- Liquid water becomes water vapor (you can't see it!)

**Real-life examples:**
- Puddles disappearing after rain
- Wet clothes drying on a clothesline
- Your skin drying after swimming

### 2. Condensation ☁️
**What happens:** Water vapor cools down and turns back into tiny water droplets

**How it works:**
- Water vapor rises high in the sky where it's cold
- Cold temperatures make vapor turn into tiny drops
- Millions of tiny drops form clouds

**Real-life examples:**
- Clouds forming in the sky
- Water drops on a cold glass of lemonade
- Fog in the morning
- Your breath visible on a cold day

### 3. Precipitation 🌧️❄️
**What happens:** Water falls back to Earth

**How it works:**
- Water droplets in clouds get bigger and heavier
- When too heavy, they fall as:
  - Rain (when warm)
  - Snow (when freezing)
  - Sleet (frozen rain)
  - Hail (ice balls)

**Where it falls:**
- On land (fills rivers, lakes, ground)
- In oceans (most of Earth!)
- On mountains (becomes snow/ice)

### 4. Collection 🌊
**What happens:** Water gathers in oceans, lakes, rivers, and underground

**How it works:**
- Rain soaks into ground (groundwater)
- Flows into streams and rivers
- Rivers flow to lakes or oceans
- Some gets trapped in ice (glaciers)
- Plants and animals drink it
- Then it evaporates again... and the cycle continues!

## Extra Steps

### Transpiration 🌳
- Plants release water vapor through their leaves
- Like plants "sweating"
- Adds lots of water to the air!

### Runoff 🏔️
- Rain that doesn't soak in flows downhill
- Creates streams and rivers
- Eventually reaches oceans

## Important Numbers

- **97%** of Earth's water is in oceans (salty!)
- **3%** is fresh water
- Most fresh water is frozen in ice caps
- Only **1%** of water is available for us to drink!

## Why the Water Cycle Matters

1. **Gives us fresh water** - Removes salt from ocean water
2. **Distributes water** - Moves water around the planet
3. **Cleans water** - Evaporation leaves pollutants behind
4. **Regulates temperature** - Helps cool and warm the Earth
5. **Supports all life** - Plants, animals, and people need water!

## Fun Facts

- The water you drink today might have been drunk by dinosaurs!
- A water molecule spends about 9 days in the atmosphere
- There's the same amount of water on Earth now as there was millions of years ago
- Oceans contain 96.5% of all water on Earth
- Your body is about 60% water!

## How Humans Use the Water Cycle

- **Drinking water**: From rivers, lakes, groundwater
- **Agriculture**: Rain waters crops
- **Hydroelectric power**: Moving water creates electricity
- **Recreation**: Swimming, boating, fishing

## Threats to the Water Cycle

- **Pollution**: Dirty water affects the whole cycle
- **Deforestation**: Fewer trees = less transpiration
- **Climate change**: Changes precipitation patterns
- **Overpumping groundwater**: Takes water faster than it's replaced

## Experiments You Can Try

### 1. Mini Water Cycle in a Bag
- Put water and a plant in a sealed plastic bag
- Hang in sunny window
- Watch water evaporate and condense!

### 2. Make It Rain
- Boil water in a pot (adult supervision!)
- Hold a cold plate above the steam
- Watch "rain" form and drip!

### 3. Evaporation Race
- Put equal water in two cups
- Place one in sun, one in shade
- Which evaporates faster?

## Key Vocabulary
