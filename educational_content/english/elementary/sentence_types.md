# Types of Sentences (Grades 3-5)

## What is a Sentence?

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. Every sentence needs two things:
1. A **subject** (who or what)
2. A **predicate** (what they do)

Example: **The dog** (subject) **ran fast** (predicate).

## The Four Types of Sentences

### 1. Declarative Sentences (Statements) 📝

**What they do:** Tell or state something
**Ending:** Period (.)
**Purpose:** Give information

**Examples:**
- The sky is blue.
- I love reading books.
- Cats are mammals.
- My birthday is in June.
- Pizza is my favorite food.

**How to recognize them:**
- They make a statement
- They end with a period
- They tell you something

### 2. Interrogative Sentences (Questions) ❓

**Ending:** Question mark (?)
**Purpose:** Get information

- Can end with . or !

### 4. Exclamatory Sentences (Exclamations) ❗

**Purpose:** Express strong feelings

**Examples:**

## Parts of a Sentence

### Subject
**What it is:** Who or what the sentence is about

**Examples:**
- **The cat** jumped on the table.
- **My sister** loves chocolate.
- **Thunder** is very loud.

**How to find it:** Ask "Who or what is doing something?"

### Predicate
**What it is:** What the subject does or is

**Examples:**
- The cat **jumped on the table**.
- My sister **loves chocolate**.
- Thunder **is very loud**.

**How to find it:** Ask "What is the subject doing?" or "What is being said about the subject?"

## Simple vs. Compound Sentences

### Simple Sentence
**What it is:** One independent thought

**Examples:**
- I like ice cream.
- The dog barked.
- She runs every day.

**Structure:** One subject + one predicate

### Compound Sentence
**What it is:** Two or more simple sentences joined together

**Examples:**
- I like ice cream, and she likes cake.
- The dog barked, but nobody heard it.
- We can go to the park, or we can stay home.

**How to make them:**
- Use FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
- Put a comma before the conjunction

## Sentence Fragments vs. Complete Sentences

### Complete Sentence ✓
Has both subject and predicate

**Examples:**
- The bird flew away.
- I am happy.
- Dogs bark loudly.

### Fragment ✗
Missing subject or predicate (incomplete thought)

**Examples of fragments:**
- Ran to the store. (Who ran?)
- The big brown dog. (What about the dog?)
- After we finished. (What happened?)

**How to fix fragments:**
- Add the missing part!
- Ran to the store → **I** ran to the store.
- The big brown dog → The big brown dog **barked**.
- After we finished → After we finished, **we went home**.

## Run-On Sentences

**What they are:** Two or more sentences incorrectly joined without proper punctuation

**Examples of run-ons:**
- ✗ I like pizza I also like burgers.
- ✗ The sun is shining it's a beautiful day.
- ✗ She ran fast she won the race.

**How to fix them:**

1. **Add a period:**
   - I like pizza**.** I also like burgers.

2. **Add a comma and conjunction:**
   - I like pizza**, and** I also like burgers.

3. **Add a semicolon:**
   - I like pizza**;** I also like burgers.

## Punctuation Rules

### Period (.)
- End of declarative sentences
- End of imperative sentences
- After abbreviations (Dr., Mr., etc.)

### Question Mark (?)
- End of interrogative sentences
- Shows you're asking something

### Exclamation Point (!)
- End of exclamatory sentences
- End of strong imperative sentences
- Shows strong emotion

**Important:** Don't overuse exclamation points! One is enough!

## Capital Letters

**Always capitalize:**
1. **First word** of every sentence
2. **Proper nouns** (names, places)
3. **The pronoun "I"**
4. **Titles** (Mr., Mrs., Dr.)
5. **Days and months** (Monday, January)

**Examples:**
- **T**he cat is sleeping.
- **M**y name is **S**arah.
- **I** live in **N**ew **Y**ork.
- **M**r. **J**ones is my teacher.

## Writing Better Sentences

### Tips for Strong Sentences:

1. **Vary sentence types** - Don't use all statements!
2. **Start sentences differently** - Not always "The..."
3. **Use specific words** - "sprinted" instead of "ran fast"
4. **Combine short sentences** - Make compound sentences
5. **Check for fragments** - Every sentence needs subject + predicate

### Examples of Improvement:

**Before (boring):**
The dog ran. The dog was fast. The dog caught the ball.

**After (better):**
The fast dog sprinted across the yard and caught the ball!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

   - ✗ I like school
   - ✓ I like school.

2. **Wrong punctuation mark**
   - ✗ Where are you going.
   - ✓ Where are you going?

3. **Sentence fragments**
   - ✗ Because it was raining.
   - ✓ We stayed inside because it was raining.

4. **Run-on sentences**
