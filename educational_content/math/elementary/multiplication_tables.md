# Multiplication Tables (Grades 2-4)

## Understanding Multiplication

Multiplication is repeated addition!
- 3 × 4 means "3 groups of 4" or "add 4 three times"
- 3 × 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

## Times Tables 1-12

### The 2 Times Table (Doubles)
- 2 × 1 = 2
- 2 × 2 = 4
- 2 × 3 = 6
- 2 × 4 = 8
- 2 × 5 = 10
- 2 × 6 = 12
- 2 × 7 = 14
- 2 × 8 = 16
- 2 × 9 = 18
- 2 × 10 = 20

Pattern: Count by 2s!

### The 5 Times Table (Count by 5s)
- 5 × 1 = 5
- 5 × 2 = 10
- 5 × 3 = 15
- 5 × 4 = 20
- 5 × 5 = 25
- 5 × 6 = 30
- 5 × 7 = 35
- 5 × 8 = 40
- 5 × 9 = 45
- 5 × 10 = 50

Pattern: All answers end in 0 or 5!

### The 10 Times Table (Easy!)
- 10 × 1 = 10
- 10 × 2 = 20
- 10 × 3 = 30
- 10 × 4 = 40
- 10 × 5 = 50

Pattern: Just add a 0 to the number!

## Memory Tricks

**For 9 Times Table:**
- 9 × 1 = 09 (0+9=9)
- 9 × 2 = 18 (1+8=9)
- 9 × 3 = 27 (2+7=9)
- Pattern: The digits always add up to 9!

**For 11 Times Table (up to 9):**
- 11 × 2 = 22 (repeat the number!)
- 11 × 3 = 33
- 11 × 4 = 44

## Practice Strategies

1. Start with the easy ones (1, 2, 5, 10)
2. Use skip counting
3. Practice with flashcards
4. Play multiplication games
5. Use real-world examples (groups of items)

## Real-Life Uses

- Counting money (quarters, dimes)
- Shopping (buying multiple items)
- Measuring (cups, teaspoons)
- Sports scores
- Sharing equally
