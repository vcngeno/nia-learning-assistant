# Understanding Fractions (Grades 3-5)

## What is a Fraction?

A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two numbers:
- **Numerator** (top number): How many parts you have
- **Denominator** (bottom number): How many equal parts the whole is divided into

Example: In 3/4, you have 3 parts out of 4 total parts.

## Visual Understanding

Think of a pizza cut into 4 equal slices:
- 1/4 = one slice
- 2/4 = two slices (also equals 1/2)
- 3/4 = three slices
- 4/4 = the whole pizza (equals 1)

## Equivalent Fractions

Fractions that represent the same amount:
- 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8
- 1/3 = 2/6 = 3/9
- 2/3 = 4/6 = 6/9

## Adding Fractions (Same Denominator)

When fractions have the same denominator:
1. Add the numerators
2. Keep the denominator the same

Examples:
- 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4
- 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5

## Practice Tips

1. Draw pictures to visualize fractions
2. Use real objects (like cutting an apple)
3. Practice finding equivalent fractions
4. Remember: the bigger the denominator, the smaller each piece!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't add denominators together
- Don't forget to simplify your answer
- Remember that 4/4 equals 1 whole

## Real-Life Examples

- Sharing pizza slices
- Measuring ingredients in cooking
- Telling time (quarter past = 1/4 hour)
- Sharing toys with friends
